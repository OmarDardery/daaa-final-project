Pattern matching is an important concept in computer science. The algorithms we're testing include:
1. Brute Force - a simple but effective approach
2. Boyer-Moore - uses clever heuristics to skip sections
3. Knuth-Morris-Pratt - uses a prefix function for efficiency

The fox is mentioned several times in this document to test multiple matches.
Another fox appears here!

Test various patterns:
- Short patterns: "the", "fox", "is"
- Longer patterns: "algorithms", "computer science"
- Case sensitivity: "The" vs "the"
- Edge cases: patterns at the start, middle, and end of the document

This document ends with the word fox.
